# Contributing to Bitcoin-Stacks Bridge

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Bitcoin-Stacks Bridge as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Smart Contract Development Guidelines

1. **Security First**

   - Always prioritize security in your changes
   - Follow established security patterns
   - Add comprehensive validation checks

2. **Testing**

   - Add tests for any new functionality
   - Ensure existing tests pass
   - Include both positive and negative test cases

3. **Documentation**

   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Document all public functions

4. **Code Style**
   - Follow the established Clarity code style
   - Keep functions focused and simple
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
