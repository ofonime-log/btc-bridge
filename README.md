# Bitcoin-Stacks Bridge Smart Contract

A secure and decentralized bridge implementation enabling cross-chain transfers between Bitcoin and Stacks networks.

## Overview

The Bitcoin-Stacks Bridge is a smart contract system that facilitates secure asset transfers between the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains. It implements a robust validator-based architecture with multiple security checks and balances to ensure safe cross-chain transactions.

## Features

- **Secure Cross-Chain Transfers**: Enable trustless transfers between Bitcoin and Stacks networks
- **Validator System**: Multi-validator architecture for enhanced security
- **Deposit Management**: Secure handling of deposits with confirmation requirements
- **Withdrawal System**: Controlled withdrawal process with safety checks
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency functions for critical situations
- **Comprehensive Security**: Multiple validation layers and checks

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Deposit System**

   - Minimum deposit: 100,000 units
   - Maximum deposit: 1,000,000,000 units
   - Required confirmations: 6

2. **Validator Framework**

   - Multi-validator support
   - Signature verification
   - Validator management system

3. **Bridge Operations**
   - Deposit initiation and confirmation
   - Secure withdrawal process
   - Balance management
   - Emergency controls

## Technical Documentation

### Key Functions

#### Deposit Management

```clarity
(define-public (initiate-deposit
    (tx-hash (buff 32))
    (amount uint)
    (recipient principal)
    (btc-sender (buff 33))
)
```

Initiates a new deposit into the bridge. Only authorized validators can call this function.

#### Withdrawal Process

```clarity
(define-public (withdraw
    (amount uint)
    (btc-recipient (buff 34))
)
```

Processes withdrawals from the bridge to Bitcoin addresses.

### Error Codes

- `ERROR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (u1000)`: Unauthorized access attempt
- `ERROR-INVALID-AMOUNT (u1001)`: Amount outside allowed range
- `ERROR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE (u1002)`: Insufficient funds
- `ERROR-INVALID-BRIDGE-STATUS (u1003)`: Invalid bridge state
- `ERROR-INVALID-SIGNATURE (u1004)`: Invalid signature
- And more...

## Setup and Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize the bridge using `initialize-bridge`
3. Add validators using `add-validator`
4. The bridge is ready for operations

## Security Considerations

- Multi-validator architecture ensures no single point of failure
- Required confirmations prevent premature processing
- Amount limits protect against extreme transactions
- Emergency controls for critical situations
- Comprehensive validation checks

## Testing

Thorough testing is required for:

- Deposit processing
- Withdrawal mechanisms
- Validator operations
- Security controls
- Error handling
